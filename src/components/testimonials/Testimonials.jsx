I worked with him for one of the Wipro's Client National Stock Exchange of India and his contribution in that project was commendable.
when its comes to Frontend ,His skill are so amazing and optimized.
He thinks of the problem first and plans which code is less as well as efficient for the respective UI.  </small>
